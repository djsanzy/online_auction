# online_auction

This is a beginner python code of bidding an auction online.
There is no interface or gui. This repository is only code.
Firstly, i created an empyty dictionary.
Created a function that takes in bid and the bid should contain the name of the person
bidding and the amount. And also calculates the bid so that it can output the name and 
the amount of bid the user bid.
Created a while loop that will continue running once there are stil people bidding but
then comes out of the loop once the bidders says no and the run the function whereby it
runs through the bidders and there name to bring out the winner.
Lastly, the loops stops when you input a wrong answer to the question asked.
